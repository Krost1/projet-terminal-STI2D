# Automatic hen house



This is the web page of the project that I had to 
do in groupin  my last year in high school (STI2D) 
(automatic hen house) allowing 
in particular to see who worked on the educational project,
by who it is carried out, where it is located.

all the functional parts such as the 
possibility of observing the hens using a surveillance 
camera, access to hygrometric sensors... could not be 
implemented (due to lack of time and lack of knowledge)
